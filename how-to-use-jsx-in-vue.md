# How to use JSX in Vue

I previously only used for about a year and JSX is the only way to create views. Although I eventually got used to it, it was a breath of fresh air when I moved to Vue's templating system. However, since Vue has templates enabled by default, I never got to try out Vue in JSX mode.

Today I'll focus on JSX and spend a few hours getting a sample together.

First thing I did was `google Vue JSX`. The first result links to \[testing\]\(https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiC7ITZy\_\_TAhVI5GMKHUhdCpcQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvuejs.org%2Fv2%2Fguide%2Frender-function.html&usg=AFQjCNGsaHF2lKIKeqtZSG3fEWBRAEUBvA\).

It starts by describing where it makes sense to move away from a templating language to JSX. You should read it and get to the actual `#JSX` section. From the looks of it, it should be straight forward and all you really need is the babel JSX plugin for Vue.

All the examples here are not within a .vue file. This concerns me a little as maybe you cannot use JSX in .vue files.
